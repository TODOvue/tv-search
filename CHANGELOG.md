## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-18

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-search.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
  - For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-search/style.css'` in `main.ts`
  - For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-search/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed
- The emit event is fixed to send the selected object and not the input.

### Changed
- Corrected demo application routes.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-17

### Changed
- The library build now uses `src/entry.ts` (exports both the component and the plugin) instead of directly exporting the `.vue` file.
- CSS injection via JS has been removed for the library build (it is only kept for the demo), generating a `tv-search.css` file optimized for SSR/Nuxt.
- Changed node-version to workflows release.yml to 20.

### Added
- Plugin installation support: `app.use(TvSearch)` or `app.use(TvSearchPlugin)`.
